# BCFW-for-Structured-SVMs

## Introduction
This is the final project of the Optimization course for the Data Science MSc. In this group project we were asked to analyze deeply some papers regarding the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the structured SVMs. Then, we had to implement the algorithm on one of the possible dataset. We chose the CoNLL 2000 dataset, working in a text-chunking problem.

## File
The file in this repository are three: the README file, that you are reading, the Code fold, which contains all the code we have implemented in MatLab to solve the problem, and the PDF which includes report of the experiment and an exhaustive explanation of the theory we have learned.
